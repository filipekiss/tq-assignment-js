1. **What is the biggest benefit you would bring to Tiqets as Frontend Developer?**

I have 10+ years of experience developing web applications, including backend
experience. I am always thinking creatively and looking for unconventional ways
to solve problems. I am very curious and like to understand the reasons why
something is being done.

2. **Based on the technology stack in Tiqets' frontend, which area would you consider yourself most experienced in?**

I have a deep understanding of the fundamentals of javascript, including some
internals like the event loop. I also have great experience with TypeScript,
including generics and custom types, as well as migrating legacy code to a more
modern approach.

3. **Based on the technology stack in Tiqets' frontend, on which area would you like to grow the most and learn from other Tiqets' developers?**

I really want to learn the understandings of the backend and how the stack is
structured, so I can have a better understanding of the whole process.

4. **Based on a frontend task or technical challenge you had worked on previously, tell us: what did you learn from it? And how would those learnings help you while working with us?**

I had one particular issue at a previous job which was some data being recorded
in a wrong format in a database. We had lost thousands of records because of
this, since the information being stored was the phone number. I proposed
a solution that reached out to these people and asked them to update their
information. Because of that, we were able to recover around 30% of the phone
numbers that were not correctly saved. This was the first time that I rose to
a situation and proposed a solution that was not technical and it was accepted.
It made me realize that If I better understand how the whole thing works I can
pitch ideas that are not limited to technical aspects and this is something I've
brought with me since that day: my curiosity to learn about the whole process
and pitch ideas that are not just "we should use this new framework".
